### Wazzzzzzupppppppp 👋

My name is Ryan! I feel like I'm never really able to holistically describe myself in these types of bio fields. Here are a few things about me though!

#### Within tech

I've held a number of full-stack web platform positions utilizing C# / dotnet and adjacent technologies.

In addition to my full-time positions over the years, I'm also active as an instructor with a local non-profit meant to help newer developers establish a solid footing in the tech industry, [@LaunchCode](https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation)! 🚀

#### Outside of tech

⚡ interests include: Competitive gaming, VR, rollerblading, running, percussion (mostly vibraphone, drum set, and auxiliary), streaming, leftist politics, and traveling (pre-pandemic ☣️)
